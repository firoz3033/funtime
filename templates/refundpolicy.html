        <h2>Late or Missing Refunds</h2>

            If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
